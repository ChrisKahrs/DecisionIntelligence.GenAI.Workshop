      "\n",
      "### 5. **The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)**\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Overview:\n",
      "Developed by military strategist John Boyd, the OODA Loop is a continuous cycle that focuses on quickly adapting to changing situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### How to Use:\n",
      "- **Observe:** Gather current information from the environment.\n",
      "- **Orient:** Analyze the information and form hypotheses.\n",
      "- **Decide:** Choose the best hypothetical course of action.\n",
      "- **Act:** Implement the decision and observe the results, then repeat the loop.\n",
