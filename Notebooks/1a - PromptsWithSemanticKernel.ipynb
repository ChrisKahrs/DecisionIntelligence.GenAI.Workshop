      "1. **SWOT Analysis**:\n",
      "   - **Strengths**: Identify what advantages your organization or project has.\n",
      "   - **Weaknesses**: Recognize areas of improvement or limitations.\n",
      "   - **Opportunities**: Look for external factors that could be beneficial.\n",
      "   - **Threats**: Be aware of external challenges that could affect your goals.\n",
      "   - *Application*: Use this framework to evaluate a decision’s potential by analyzing these four aspects, which can help in making more informed, balanced decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decision Matrix** (also known as Pugh Matrix):\n",
      "   - **Criteria**: List the factors that are important for making the decision.\n",
      "   - **Options**: Write down the different choices available.\n",
      "   - **Weighting**: Assign a weight to each criterion based on its importance.\n",
      "   - **Scoring**: Rate each option based on how well it meets each criterion.\n",
      "   - **Totaling**: Multiply scores by the weights and sum them to get an overall score for each option.\n",
      "   - *Application*: This helps in comparing multiple options based on several criteria, making it easier to see which option scores highest according to your prioritized needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:\n",
      "   - **Costs**: Calculate the total costs associated with each decision option.\n",
      "   - **Benefits**: Estimate the benefits each option will provide, quantifying them if possible.\n",
      "   - **Net Benefit**: Subtract the total costs from the benefits to determine the net benefit.\n",
      "   - *Application*: This framework helps in understanding the economic value of different decisions, guiding you towards options that provide the greatest net benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pros and Cons List**:\n",
      "   - **Pros**: List all the positive aspects and advantages of each decision option.\n",
      "   - **Cons**: List all the negative aspects and disadvantages.\n",
      "   - *Application*: This simple yet effective method allows for a straightforward comparison of different options, highlighting the immediate impacts and outcomes of each choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Decision Trees**:\n",
      "   - **Decision Nodes**: Points where decisions are made.\n",
      "   - **Chance Nodes**: Points where chance outcomes occur.\n",
      "   - **End Nodes**: Final outcomes after decisions and chance events.\n",
      "   - *Application*: Useful for complex decisions with multiple stages and outcomes, allowing you to visualize paths and consequences, and calculate expected values for different scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)**:\n",
      "   - **Identify Issues**: List all issues related to the decision.\n",
      "   - **Score Issues**: Score issues based on their significance.\n",
      "   - **Cumulative Score**: Calculate the cumulative impact of these issues.\n",
      "   - **Analysis**: Focus on the top 20% of issues that might result in 80% of the impact.\n",
      "   - *Application*: This helps prioritize elements that have the most significant impact, ensuring efficient allocation of resources and efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Six Thinking Hats**:\n",
      "   - **White Hat**: Focus on the data available.\n",
      "   - **Red Hat**: Look at the decision using intuition and emotion.\n",
      "   - **Black Hat**: Consider the negative outcomes.\n",
      "   - **Yellow Hat**: Think optimistically about the positives.\n",
      "   - **Green Hat**: Think creatively for alternative solutions.\n",
      "   - **Blue Hat**: Manage the thinking process and ensure each hat is used.\n",
      "   - *Application*: This method encourages looking at a decision from multiple perspectives, reducing the bias and encouraging diverse thinking.\n",
