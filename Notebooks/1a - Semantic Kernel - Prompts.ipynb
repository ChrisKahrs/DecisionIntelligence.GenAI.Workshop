      "   - Simply list down the advantages and disadvantages of each option.\n",
      "   - This method helps in visualizing the positive and negative aspects of each decision.\n",
      "   - *Application*: Useful for straightforward decisions that don’t require detailed analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)**:\n",
      "   - Identify the few critical items that produce the most significant effect.\n",
      "   - Focus on those 20% of the factors that will impact 80% of the results.\n",
      "   - *Application*: Effective in prioritizing the factors that will have the greatest impact on the decision.\n",

      "6. **Six Thinking Hats** by Edward de Bono:\n",
      "   - White Hat: Focus on the data available.\n",
      "   - Red Hat: Look at the decision using intuition, gut reaction, and emotion.\n",
      "   - Black Hat: Consider it cautiously and defensively.\n",
      "   - Yellow Hat: Think positively and optimistically.\n",
      "   - Green Hat: Think creatively and outside the box.\n",
      "   - Blue Hat: Manage the thinking process and ensure that guidelines are followed.\n",
      "   - *Application*: This method encourages diverse perspectives and a rounded view of a situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Scenario Analysis**:\n",
      "   - Develop different scenarios based on various assumptions about the future.\n",
      "   - Analyze how different decisions might play out under these scenarios.\n",
      "   - *Application*: Useful for long-term strategic decisions where future uncertainty is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Decision Trees**:\n",
      "   - Create a tree diagram to represent different choices and their possible outcomes, including risks, costs, and benefits.\n",
      "   - Calculate the expected value for different branches to see which option might be the most beneficial.\n",
      "   - *Application*: Helpful for decisions that involve a series of steps and outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these frameworks can be used individually or in combination depending on the complexity and nature of the decision to be made. It's also important to consider the context and the impact of the decision on all stakeholders involved."
