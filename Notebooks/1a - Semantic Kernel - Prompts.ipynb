    "All the best practices of prompt engineering apply when using Semantic Kernel.  \n",
    "* Make the prompt more specific\n",
    "* Add structure to the output with formatting\n",

    "* Using message roles in chat completion prompts\n",
    "* Give your AI words of encouragement  \n",
    "\n",
    "One best practice is to provide a common behaviour across all the LLM interactions in a system prompt. This system prompt is passed in on every single call the LLM with Semantic Kernel. These prompts can be dynamically created with a programming language like C#.\n",

      "### 1. **SWOT Analysis**\n",
      "**Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Strengths:** Identify internal attributes that are helpful to achieving the objective.\n",
      "- **Weaknesses:** Identify internal attributes that are harmful to achieving the objective.\n",
      "- **Opportunities:** Identify external conditions that are helpful to achieving the objective.\n",
      "- **Threats:** Identify external conditions that could do damage to the objective.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Case:** Strategic planning, business development, personal career planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Decision Matrix (Weighted Scoring)**\n",
      "**Criteria-based evaluation**\n",
      "\n",
      "- List all the options.\n",
      "- Identify the criteria important for the decision.\n",
      "- Assign weights to each criterion based on importance.\n",
      "- Score each option against each criterion.\n",
      "- Multiply the scores by the weights and sum them up for each option.\n",
      "- The option with the highest total score is the preferred choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Use Case:** Choosing between multiple alternatives, product selection, vendor selection.\n",

      "**Financial evaluation**\n",
      "\n",
      "- List all the costs associated with each option.\n",
      "- List all the benefits associated with each option.\n",
      "- Assign a monetary value to both costs and benefits.\n",
