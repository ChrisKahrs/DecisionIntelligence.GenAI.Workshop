      "   - **Opportunities**: Look for external factors that could be leveraged for success.\n",
      "   - **Threats**: Be aware of external challenges that could cause problems.\n",
      "   - **Application**: Use this framework to evaluate a decision from all angles, ensuring a balanced view of all critical factors.\n",

      "2. **Decision Matrix** (also known as a Pugh Matrix):\n",
      "   - **Criteria**: List the factors that are important for making the decision.\n",
      "   - **Options**: Write down the different choices available.\n",
      "   - **Weighting**: Assign a weight to each criterion based on its importance.\n",
      "   - **Scoring**: Rate each option on each criterion.\n",
      "   - **Calculation**: Multiply the scores by the weights and sum them to get an overall score for each option.\n",
      "   - **Application**: This method quantifies options and helps in making objective decisions based on a set of relevant criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:\n",
      "   - **Costs**: Identify all costs associated with each decision option.\n",
      "   - **Benefits**: Determine all benefits that each option would provide.\n",
      "   - **Comparison**: Weigh the total expected costs against the total expected benefits.\n",
      "   - **Application**: This framework is useful for straightforward decisions where tangible costs and benefits can be easily quantified.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Pros and Cons List**:\n",
      "   - **Pros**: List all the positive aspects and advantages of each option.\n",
      "   - **Cons**: List all the negative aspects and disadvantages.\n",
      "   - **Evaluation**: Compare the pros and cons to see which option has the most favorable balance.\n",
      "   - **Application**: This is a simple and effective method for smaller or less complex decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Six Thinking Hats** by Edward de Bono:\n",
      "   - **White Hat**: Focus on the available data and information.\n",
      "   - **Red Hat**: Look at the decision using intuition and emotion.\n",
      "   - **Black Hat**: Consider the negative outcomes and why it might not work.\n",
      "   - **Yellow Hat**: Think optimistically and explore the positives.\n",
      "   - **Green Hat**: Think creatively and propose alternative solutions.\n",
      "   - **Blue Hat**: Manage the thinking process and ensure each hat is utilized.\n",
      "   - **Application**: This framework encourages looking at a decision from multiple perspectives, reducing the blind spots in decision-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **The Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)**:\n",
      "   - **Identification**: Identify the 20% of the factors that will influence 80% of the results.\n",
      "   - **Focus**: Concentrate on these key factors to achieve the most effective outcomes.\n",
      "   - **Application**: This principle helps in prioritizing efforts that are most likely to have the greatest impact, making it useful in resource allocation and time management.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Expected Utility Theory**:\n",
      "   - **Outcomes**: List all possible outcomes for each decision.\n",
