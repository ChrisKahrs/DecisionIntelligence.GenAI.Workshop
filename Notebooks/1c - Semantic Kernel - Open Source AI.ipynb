      "When purchasing a secondary home as an investment property, there are several key factors that you need to take into consideration. Here is a list of some important aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Location: The location of your investment property plays a crucial role in determining its potential for appreciation and rental income. Look for areas with strong job markets, good schools, low crime rates, and access to amenities such as shopping centers, parks, and public transportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Market conditions: Research the local real estate market trends, including property values, supply and demand, vacancy rates, and rental prices. This will help you determine if it's a good time to invest in that particular area.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Property type: Consider the type of property that would best suit your investment goals. For example, single-family homes may be easier to rent out than multi-unit properties or condos, but they might also require more maintenance and upkeep.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Financing options: Determine how you will finance the purchase of your investment property. You'll need to consider factors such as down payment requirements, interest rates, loan terms, and potential tax implications.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Cash flow analysis: Calculate the expected rental income from the property and compare it with expenses like mortgage payments, insurance, property management fees, maintenance costs, and vacancy allowances to determine if you'll have positive cash flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Property condition: Assess the current state of the property and estimate any necessary repairs or renovations that may be needed before renting it out. This will help you budget for these expenses and avoid unexpected costs down the line.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Rental potential: Research comparable rental properties in the area to determine a competitive rental price. Consider factors such as property size, location, amenities, and condition when setting your rental rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Property management: Decide if you will manage the property yourself or hire a professional property manager. If you choose to self-manage, be prepared for the time commitment involved in finding tenants, collecting rent, handling maintenance requests, and dealing with any issues that may arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Legal considerations: Familiarize yourself with local landlord-tenant laws, zoning regulations, and property taxes to ensure you are compliant with all legal requirements as a landlord.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Exit strategy: Consider your long-term goals for the investment property and have an exit strategy in place if needed. This could include selling the property after a certain period or refinancing it to access equity.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully considering these factors, you can make an informed decision when purchasing a secondary home as an investment property that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance."

    "- Label the top of one side \"Pro\" (for) and the other \"Con\" (against)\n",

    "- After spending some time thinking exhaustively and writing down the reasons, weight the different Pro and Con reasons/arguments\n",
    "- Determine the relative importance of each reason or argument. This is done by taking reasons/arguments that are of similar value (weight) and crossing them off of the other competing half. Multiple reasons can be combined from one side to form a \"subjective\" value (weight) to balance out the other half. (For example, two medium \"Pro\" reasons might add up to an equal value of a single important \"Con\" reason)\n",
