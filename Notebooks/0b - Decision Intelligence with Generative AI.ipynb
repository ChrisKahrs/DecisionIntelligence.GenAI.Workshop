    "Decision-making ability is regarded by executives as one of the most highly desired business skills! Most people (even business professionals) make decisions using simple intuition. However, when the problem is sufficiently important, the chance of making a mistake is high or the decision outcome stakes are high; it is important to apply Decision Intelligence to solve those problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To most people, making quality systematic decisions can be a daunting task. There is good news though!! It has been shown that in the same way with the training of top-tier athletes, decision-makers can employ techniques, plans, and instruments to improve and achieve more. This can include:  \n",
    "* Framing the Decision in different perspectives  \n",
    "* Gathering the Information and Intelligence for the Decision  \n",
    "* Making the Decision using a Systematic Framework  \n",
    "* Communicating the Decision & Monitoring the Decision Outcome  \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Intelligence sounds interesting, but what does this have todo with Generative AI? Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities possess potential for enhancing decision-making processes through advanced reasoning abilities. These LLMs have been trained on complex data sets with logic, patterns, outputting source (programming) code, problem solving in mind. This allows them to simulate human-like reasoning, offering insights and recommendations based on comprehensive data analysis. So what does this all mean? This means that all the past decision-making, problem-solving, mental models, decision huersistics can be appllied to LLMs with GenAI and help humans make decisions!\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine there has been much study, thought and literature written on decision-making. There are examples and resources provided below to immerse yourself into the paradigm. Therefore, this workshop isn't meant to be a full introduction Decision Intelligence or Decision-Making, but will be used as the context for the GenAI exercises seen throughout. It is meant to show how you \"really\" can make decisions with AI & GenAI and not just apply simple prompt techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So do you need to read a ton of information before getting started with the workshop? Not necessarily. The workshop will introduce specific Decision Intelligence topics and showcase how they can be applied with GenAI. In order to make progress, the workshop has to start somewhere. To start most people getting familiar with decision intelligence focus on the \"Making the Decision\" step. This is not ideal, but a great place to start is with simple decision mental models or decision hueristics, which can be effectively applied to many business decisions. This is where most of the workshop content will be applied.  "
